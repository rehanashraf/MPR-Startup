Add a remote branch:
git push origin master:new_feature_name

Check if everything is good (fetch origin and list remote branches):
git fetch origin
git branch -r

Create a local branch and track the remote branch:
git checkout -tb new_feature_name origin/new_feature_name


Update everything:
git pull


“first clone
than make your own branch
then set the upstream branch git push -u origin yourbranchname”

git branch -a #shows all remote and local repositories

git branch -r #shows all remote repositories

git branch -d the_local_branch #delete local branch

git push origin :the_remote_branch #delete remote branch


git merge remotename/branchname # Merges updates made online with your local work
git merge local-branch # will merge the local-branch into the working branch

git pull remotename branchname	 # Grabso online updates and merges them with your local work
git pull origin my_remote_branch:my_local_branch

git push origin <branch> # pushes to the branch on github from the current branch 
git push <remote> <local branch name>:<remote branch to push into>


git reset --hard origin/master #overwrite all the stuff that you did and messed up all the stuff. 

git push --force origin B:C
